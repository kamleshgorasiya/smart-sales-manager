# smart-sales-manager using Spring Boot- Spring Security Jwt Authentication with real time situation handling.

This is a sample project to provide example on how to add JWT token authentication in a spring boot application.
The example uses maven as a build tool and also sample script to run on application startup so that anybody can get started by simply running Application.java
 
I have additionaly added the following library in POM. you can remove that file if your machine running with lesser or equal 1.9 JDK. but for 1.10 or JAVA10 You must need to keep it within POM.

		    <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
		    <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
		    </dependency>
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
